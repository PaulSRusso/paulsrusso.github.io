      <description>Jchart is a project I started several years ago in the Java 1.0 time frame around 1996. It was originally a Java applet but is now a stand alone desktop application. I use it almost daily and have open sourced it. I have several other projects based on Jchart such as trading systems, stock screening, and overall market breadth indicators. The open sourced Jchart includes a money flow indicator I have developed based on price, volume and Japaneese candlesticks.</description>
